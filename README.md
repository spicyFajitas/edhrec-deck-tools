# EDHRec Deck Building Scripts

These Python programs are aimed at helping deckbuilders follow trends for building their EDH/Commander decks. The scripts get cardlists for a given commander from EDHRec and save them as text files that can be uploaded to sites like Moxfield, Archidekt, MPC Autofill, etc.

## Setup and Example

```shell
user@pc:~$ python3 -m venv venv-magic-script
user@pc:~$ source venv-magic-scripts/bin/activate
(venv-magic-scripts) user@pc:~$ pip install requests
(venv-magic-scripts) user@pc:~$ pip install tqdm
```

## Usage - EDHRec Recommendations

```shell
(venv-magic-scripts) user@pc:~$ python3 edhrec_json_to_txt.py 
In format_commander_name and formatted name is mr-orfeo-the-boulder
In format_commander_name and formatted name is mr-orfeo-the-boulder
JSON request successful!

## Usage - EDHRec Decklist Statistics

Edit `commander.txt` with your commander you want to search for. The name should be the official card name

Example: `Mr. Orfeo, the Boulder`

```shell
(venv-magic-scripts) user@pc:~$ python3 edhrec_decklists_json_to_txt.py 
Output directory cleaned: ./output/mr-orfeo-the-boulder/edhrec-decklists-compilation
Commander is:  Mr. Orfeo, the Boulder
How many recent decks to use?: 5
Minimum deck price?: 1
Maximum deck price?: 100

```

## Outputs

The outputs folder stores text files geenrated by running the scripts. The text files can be easily imported into online deck builders. The outputs folder will store the results for the latest runs. Subsequent script runs for the same commander delete the previous run's data and gather fresh data. This can be disabled by commenting out the `clean_output_directories(formatted_name)` function call in the main function of the `edhrec_decklists_json_to_txt.py` script.

### EDHRec Suggestions

The `edhrec_json_to_txt.py` script takes card suggestion categories you see when browsing the EDHRec website and organizes those cards into text files.

### EDHRec Decklists Statistics

The `edhrec_decklists_json_to_txt.py` script is a bit more involved and aggregates data that EDHRec pulls from different decklist sites. The decks can be filtered down with a budget range and by the most recent X number decks, specified at script runtime. The advantage of this script is data is aggregated into text files instead of having to click through each decklist on the EDHRec website.

![EDHRec Deck by DeckID](./files/edhrec-commander-deck-by-deckid.png)

```shell
(venv-magic-scripts) user@pc:~$ tree output/
output/
└── mr-orfeo-the-boulder
    ├── edhrec-decklists
    │   ├── cards_artifact.txt
    │   ├── cards_creature.txt
    │   ├── cards_enchantment.txt
    │   ├── cards_instant.txt
    │   ├── cards_land.txt
    │   ├── cards_planeswalker.txt

```

In this example, the statistics are from the latest 5 decks between budgets of $1 and $100. The output of the `master_card_counts.txt` file shows the top most commonly used cards to make a deck using Mr. Orfro, the Boulder and how many times the specific card appeared in those 5 decks (hence why so many basic lands). The various card types are also sorted into separate files, in case you're looking for specific card types.

## Cache

The `edhrec_decklists_json_to_txt.py` script is set up to pull EDHRec decklists for the specified commander and store them locally in a cache directory folder. The EDHRec decklists are stored by their unique urlhash, or DeckID that can be seen when browsing the EDHRec website. It also pulls scryfall data and caches it locally, giving each card a primary card type label for the sorting functionality.

### Cache directory structure
